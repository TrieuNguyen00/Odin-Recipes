The purpose of this project is to create an HTML page which links to a few directories.
This project will demonstrate my skills of using basic git funtions and HTML.

Skills I learned from this project:
Fractions in html
lists can be more efficient than paragraphing.
Commiting often is helpful. Need to be more mindful to commmit frequently.
