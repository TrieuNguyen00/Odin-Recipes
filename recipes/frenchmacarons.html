        <h4>French Macarons, Final Product</h4>
        <h3>Ingredients Needed:</h3>
        <h5>Macarons</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>3 extra-large egg whites</li>
            <li>&frac13; cup white sugar </li>
            <li>1&frac23; cups confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup almond flour</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Buttercream Filling</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>&frac12; cup softened butter</li>
            <li>&frac23; cup confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>&frac12; teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <h5>Step 1</h5>
        <p>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</p>
        <h5>Step 2</h5>
        <p>Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until foamy, about 30 seconds.<p>
        <p>Add white sugar and continue to beat until peaks are stiff enough they stay in place when the bowl is turned upside down, about 5 minutes.</p>
        <h5>Step 3</h5>
        <p>Sift 1 2/3 cup confectioners' sugar, almond flour, and salt together twice.</p>
        <p>Fold into the egg whites until batter is creamy and falls slowly off the lifted spatula, about 50 turns with a spatula</p>
        <p>Transfer batter to a piping bag fitted with a round tip.</p>
        <h5>Step 4</h5>
        <p>Pipe batter onto the parchment paper, using a circular motion to make macarons 1 inch in diameter.</p>
        <p>Tap the baking sheet against the counter about 10 times to release any air bubbles.</p>
        <h5>Step 5</h5>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 9 minutes.</p>
        <p>Rotate baking sheet and continue baking until macarons are shiny and rise slightly to form "feet", about 9 minutes more.</p>
        <p>Peel off the parchment paper and allow to cool completely, about 30 minutes.</p>
        <h5>Step 6</h5>
        <p>Beat butter, 2/3 cup confectioners' sugar, and vanilla extract with an electric mixer until creamy and thick, about 10 minutes. </p>
        <p>Transfer filling to a piping bag fitted with a round tip.</p>
        <h5>Step 7</h5>
        <p>Pipe a small amount of filling onto the center of 1 macaron; top with another macaron and press gently to sandwich the filling between the two.</p>
